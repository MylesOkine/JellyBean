# My Most Played Steam Games

10. ## **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**
  I have *20 hours* on record for this game, and I'm really enjoying it silimar to the first one **Shadow of Mordor**. The combat is very fluid with the abilities, and the skill tree is superior to compared to the previous game. Shadow of War is oriented more towards building your army, and conquering other Uruks. I enjoy playing this game when I'm bored.

  8.## **Call of Duty: Black Ops III**
    I played this game heavily on my Xbox during the 2015 release. I played mulitplayer and zombies religously gaining master prestige 6xx something if I remember. Later on late 2018 I purchased this game on PC for the Zombies modes and workshop. It's very enjoyable with friends and it's all free
